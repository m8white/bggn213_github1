```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
pdbstats

#pdbstats_numeric <- as.numeric(pdb_stats$c("X.ray", "EM", "NMR", "Total"))
```

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$Total
#Write function that can remove commas then make character into a numeric
convert_comma_numbers <- function(x) {
  #remove commas
x <- gsub(",", "", x)

x <- as.numeric(x)

return(x)
}

convert_comma_numbers(x)
```

```{r}
n.tot <- sum(convert_comma_numbers(pdbstats$Total))
n.tot
```

>Alternative mode of loading data that does not require the conversion function

```{r}
#this readr package with read _ csv instead of .csv will read in values as numeric even with commas
library(readr)
pdbstats_numeric <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats_numeric

```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
sum(pdbstats_numeric$`X-ray`)/sum(pdbstats_numeric$Total)
sum(pdbstats_numeric$EM)/sum(pdbstats_numeric$Total)

```

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
pdbstats_numeric$Total
195866/sum(pdbstats_numeric$Total)

#library(dplyr)
#pdbstats_numeric |>
 # filter(`Molecular Type`=="Protein")



```

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

4,563 diff structures!


##Using Mol*

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure does not show hydrogen anywhere since it is smaller than the 2 Angstrom resolution of the group's protein structure.

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

this is water 308 in the structure.

## Bio3D package for structural Bioinformatics

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)

```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)[25]
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH and MK1
>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))

```

##Functional dynamics prediction

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
summary(adk)
```

```{r}
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
library(r3dmol)

#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "yellow")
```


```{r}
#Tells fluctuation
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```


```{r}
#The 3 lines of code that give us trajectory file that can view in Mol-star to show flexibility of protein structure. 

adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
modes <- nma(adk)
mktrj(modes, file = "adk.pdb")
```
